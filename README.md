# Amazon-Product-Recommendation-system
<p>In the past ten years, the discipline of natural language processing, a branch of machine learning, has experienced tremendous growth. Sentiment analysis is one of the main areas where NLP has been used most frequently. Organizations must have a thorough grasp of customer behaviour and needs as they relate to their goods and services. Customer reviews of a product are typically divided into three categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. Companies can determine how satisfied their customers are with their goods and services by interpreting customer comments from product reviews.

<p>The dataset we are using for this study is a subset of the larger Amazon Product Review: Amazon mobile/electronics product reviews.
